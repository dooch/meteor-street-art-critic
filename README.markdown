NB!... With thanks to Microscope is a simple social news app that lets you share links, comment, and vote on them.

It was built with [Meteor](http://meteor.com) as a companion app to [The Meteor Book](http://themeteorbook.com), and is the "little brother" of [Telescope](http://telesc.pe), the (much more complex) open-source social news app that was the inspiration for the book.

Street Art Critic is an open source initiative to capture, preserve and critique street art from around the world.
